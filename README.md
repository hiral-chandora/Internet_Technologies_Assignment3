Internet_Technologies_Assignment3

In this individual assignment I will further enhance the Web site developed in Assignments 1 and 2 by using PHP and storing server-side information in a MySQL database. This information will have been collected in HTML Forms. It will involve the creation of simple MySQL tables to store, update and retrieve information from a Web site.

I will extend the functionality of the product selection and order Web site developed in Assignment 2 by sending the details of a user and their orders to the server. In addition, I will create a Web page that allows a vendor to view and update orders. The vendor will be able to mark pending orders as “fulfilled” or “paid”, and be able to delete them.
