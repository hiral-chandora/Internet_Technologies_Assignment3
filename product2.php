				<h2>Guide</h2>
				<h3>About Cairo</h3>
				<p>A city upon the Nile that has been inspiring humanity and drawing visitors since the dawn of recorded history, Cairo’s one-of-a-kind allure is as alive today as ever.</p>
				<p>Cairo is a massive city with a long and well-preserved history of habitation that reaches back to the times of the Pharaohs, the Romans and the Greeks. The city almost resembles a pop-up book of architectural history with so many different period styles erected in a single space.</p>
				<h3>Ancient Egypt</h3>
				<p>Cairo is home to the Egyptian Museum, which contains an overwhelming amount of ancient artefacts and mummies, and is an important stop on any aspiring Egyptologist’s tour. However, Cairo itself is home to only a fraction of the standing monuments and burial sites of the pharaohs, which are well-scattered throughout Upper Egypt.</p>
				<h3>Dining and Nightlife</h3>
				<p>To experience authentic fare in Cairo, head to the ubiquitous street cafe to sample three popular Egyptian dishes: foul medammas, koshary and falafel. Vegetarian and filling, these grain and legume-based dishes will help get you through a busy day.</p>
